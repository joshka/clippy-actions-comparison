**Not relevant results (appear in search but not clippy-focused):**

- [BluBracket Community Edition](https://github.com/marketplace/blubracket-community-edition): BluBracket is like Clippy for code security, but‚Äînot as annoying and a lot more effective.
- [rs-doc-check](https://github.com/unk1ndled/rs-doc-check): Run rustdoc and annotate the diff with errors and warnings (fork of rs-clippy-check).

This repo will have a branch for each action to test the CI output.
