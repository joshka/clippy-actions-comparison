# Comparison of Clippy GitHub Actions

There are a few [GitHub actions for clippy linting](https://github.com/marketplace?query=clippy).

- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rust-clippy-check> - deprecated - several forks
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/clippy-action> - forked (283 commits)
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/clippy-check> - 482 commits
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rs-clippy-check> - forked (92 commits)
- <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rust-clippy-reborn> - forked "unstable right now" (64 commits)

There are others, but they seem to solve more complex ideas than just clippy (e.g. fixing lints /
integrating with reviewdog)

This repo will have a branch for each action to test the CI output.
